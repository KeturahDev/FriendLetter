    <h1>Hello From Afar</h1>
    <!-- The @ character indicates the start of Razor code. The Razor engine will evaluate anything following this symbol. -->
    <!-- Model is a property that Razor provides so we can access the model that's passed into the view. -->
    <!-- because LetterVariable is in model, we can access the LetterVariable's Recipient property, which will be a unique name -->
    <p>Dear @Model.Recipient,</p>
    <p>How are you? I hope that you are having a nice weekend. I'm vacationing in Iceland while I learn programming! </p>
    <p>@Model.Recipient, you would not believe how cold it is here. I should have gone to Hawaii instead.</p>
    <p>But I like programming a lot, so I've got that going for me. </p>
    <p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir. </p>
    <p>Cheers,</p>
    <p>Travel Enthusiast Jane</p>
